"Multiclass Fish Image Classification"

Problem Statement:
This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using deep learning models. The task involves training a CNN from scratch and leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models to enhance performance. The project also includes saving models for later use and deploying a Streamlit application to predict fish categories from user-uploaded images.
